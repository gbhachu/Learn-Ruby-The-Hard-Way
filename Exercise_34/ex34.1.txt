With what you know of the difference between these types of numbers, can you explain why the year 2010 in "January 1, 2010," really is 2010 and not 2009? 
(Hint: you can't pick years at random.)

January 1st means the first or the 0 index position and therefore it is the beginning of 2010 dates, it does not belong in 2009
