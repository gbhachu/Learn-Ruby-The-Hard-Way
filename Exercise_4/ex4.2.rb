# I used 4.0 for space_in_a_car, but is that necessary? What happens if it's just 4?

puts "4.0 is a floating point number. It is important because we donâ€™t always want the number to be rounded down."
puts "Sometimes it is important to know exactly how much we have i.e. when we are counting money."
