# Find out why we had to pass a 'w' as an extra parameter to open.
# Hint: open tries to be safe by making you explicitly say you want to write a file.

# => The extra parameter tells the program what you wish to do with the file, the default is set at 'r' and therefore is not needed if you only wish to read the file
